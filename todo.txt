This section will essentially be a much smaller version of the left table

It will contain some sort of marker to show that the images were loaded correctly

There will also be a text marker perhaps some cursive writing thats extremely small
Not sure on whether i want this div to be static. might be a hassle to code

To Do

Create a layout to show what the content of each box has
Remove the smaller buttons and replace them with the save all button on the right
Hook up the last saved button to a javascript timer
Create a delete all, make sure it has a notification when you actually decide to delete
Hook things up to save locally
Probably have an error message on refresh if the person has not saved

Completed
In the far right toolbar will be where boxes are created. When a button is clicked a single box is created
When each box is created it will have a close button at the top right that will delete
Not sure if i want to put a notification on there or not. It's not a difficult thing to do though but is it stylistically the right thing to have (I dont)
