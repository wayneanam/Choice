<p>This section will essentially be a much smaller version of the left table</p>
<p>It will contain some sort of marker to show that the images were loaded correctly</p>
<p>There will also be a text marker perhaps some cursive writing thats extremely small</p>
<p>Not sure on whether i want this div to be static. might be a hassle to code</p>

<span>To Do</span>
<p>Create a layout to show what the content of each box has</p>
<p>Remove the smaller buttons and replace them with the save all button on the right</p>
<p>Hook up the last saved button to a javascript timer</p>
<p>In the far right toolbar will be where boxes are created. When a button is clicked a single box is created</p>
<p>When each box is created it will have a close button at the top right that will delete</p>
<p>Not sure if i want to put a notification on there or not. It's not a difficult thing to do though but is it stylistically the right thing to have</p>
<p>Create a delete all, make sure it has a notification when you actually decide to delete</p>
<p>Hook things up to save locally</p>
<p>Probably have an error message on refresh if the person has not saved</p>
