To Do

Completed
In the far right toolbar will be where boxes are created. When a button is clicked a single box is created
When each box is created it will have a close button at the top right that will delete
Not sure if i want to put a notification on there or not. It's not a difficult thing to do though but is it stylistically the right thing to have (I dont)
Hook up the last saved button to a javascript timer
Remove the smaller buttons and replace them with the save all button on the right
You probably want to remove the choose file input. Having direct links would probably be easier.
Create a delete all, make sure it has a notification when you actually decide to delete
Hook things up to save locally


Not Useful
Create a layout/minimap to show what the content of each box has
Probably have an error message on refresh if the person has not saved
